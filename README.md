# Random Shader Bullshit
![The classic meme...](https://i.imgflip.com/4b5jf0.jpg)

## So, what?
This is a little repo where I'll post some of my shaders. They're all used in the "Shaders" scene, with some examples.
The shaders are under the MIT licence (free to use, credits required)
Hope you like them! :wink:
